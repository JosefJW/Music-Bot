Music Bot

Welcome to the Music Bot! This bot is designed to recommend songs based on information extracted from Wikipedia articles about various songs. The bot uses data from Wikipedia to suggest tracks that match the user's interest.
Features (Work in Progress)

    Wikipedia Integration: The bot pulls information from Wikipedia to analyze and recommend songs based on song details.
    Song Suggestions: The bot suggests tracks to the user based on data it gathers from Wikipedia articles about the music or artists they’re interested in.
    Dynamic Recommendations: Recommendations are dynamically generated based on the bot's analysis of the Wikipedia page’s content.

Technologies Used

    Python: The core of the bot is written in Python.
    Wikipedia API: Used to fetch data from Wikipedia articles about artists, albums, and songs.
    Spotify API: Used to find song titles and basic information.
    Natural Language Processing (NLP): To analyze Wikipedia articles and extract meaningful song-related information.

Installation (Note that the bot currently is incomplete and will not function)

    Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
    Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

    Set up environment variables for the Spotify API (if you want to collect your own song data).
    Run the bot with the command:

python bot.py

Usage

    Start the bot in your terminal or preferred environment.
    Provide the bot with a song name or a list of song names.
    The bot will fetch the relevant Wikipedia article, process it, and return a song recommendation based on the content.

Work In Progress

    Incomplete Feature Set: The song recommendation process is still under development, and the bot's functionality is limited.
    Error Handling: The bot may sometimes provide incorrect or incomplete recommendations due to incomplete Wikipedia data or errors in parsing.
    Future Improvements:
        More advanced recommendation logic using machine learning or deeper content analysis.
